Congrats, you found the OTHER file!

There's another question in this one, but I promise it's not too tricky!

Question: What is your favourite song?
Your answer: One Day 


function foo(result){
    for (let result in foo){
        console.log(food[result])
    }
};

let result = {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3
}

foo(result);
