Congrats, you found the OTHER file!

There's another question in this one, but I promise it's not too tricky!

Question: What is your favourite song?
Your answer: Don Moen - Be Magnified
Lyrics: Be magnified O Lord
        You are highly exalted
        And there is nothing you can't do 
        O lord, my eyes are on you 
        Be magnified 
        O Lord be magnified
