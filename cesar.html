                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Caesar salad is a beloved, quintessential side option. 
                    This is probably one of the only salads that could be considered comfort food.
                    What is it about the Caesar salad that makes it so popular? Perhaps it's the crunch of the romaine, or the creaminess of the dressing, the umami kick of Parmesan cheese, or that garlicky tang. 
                    Either way, it's one of the most delicious salads in existence, and even if you order it every time you see it on a menu, we bet there's a lot you didn't know about it.

                <h2>Who Invented It?</h2>
                <p>Many people think the Caesar salad was named after Julius Caesar -- it's not. 
                    The Caesar salad was invented by an Italian man named Caesar Cardini. 
                    Caesar Cardini was born in 1896. 
                    As expected, it's a little difficult tracing someone's life so long ago. 
                    However, an advertisement from Cardini's restaurant in 1919 suggests he moved to California in the 1910s.

                    As legend has it, as a July 4 party raged, the kitchen's supplies dwindled, and Cardini improvised the dish based on what he had on hand. 
                    It was a success, and the restaurant's well-heeled clientele took their approximation of the recipe back with them to Los Angeles, 
                    where the dish slowly caught on in popularity over the next decade. By the 1940s, it had made its way to New York City, and it's been a menu mainstay ever since.
