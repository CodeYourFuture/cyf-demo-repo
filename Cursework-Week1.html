      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Practicing relaxation is paramount to managing stress. When we relax, the flow of blood increases around our body giving us more energy. 
        It helps us to have a calmer and clearer mind which aids positive thinking, concentration, memory and decision making. 
        Relaxation slows our heart rate, reduces our blood pressure and relieves tension.
      </p> 
      <p>It also aids digestion as we absorb essential nutrients more efficiently when relaxed, which helps to fight off disease and infection.
        There are many relaxation techniques, here we will explain the ones that you can do in a few minutes anywhere.

      <h2>Body Scan Meditation</h2>
      <p>For many of us, stress not only has mental and emotional symptoms, it has physical symptoms too: headaches, back pain, and heartburn are just a few of the stress-related ailments we may experience. 
        In fact, sometimes we are so caught up in our stress, we don't even realize our physical discomfort is connected to our emotional state. 
        That's when a body scan meditation can be particularly useful and effective, allowing us to check in with our bodies.
      </p>
      <p>By mentally scanning yourself from head to toe — many people imagine a laser copier scanning the length of their body — you are bringing awareness to every single part of your body, noticing any aches, pains, tension, or general discomfort. 
        Staying present with and breathing into these sensations can help bring relief to our minds and bodies by evolving our relationship to pain, aches, and discomfort.
      </p>
      <p>Sitting comfortably, take a deep breath in through the nose, and out through the mouth. As you breathe out, close the eyes. 
        Notice how the body feels right now. Starting at the top of the head, gently scan down through the body, noticing what feels comfortable and what feels uncomfortable. 
        Remember, you're not trying to change anything, just noticing how the body feels as you scan down evenly and notice each and every part of the body, all the way down to the toes. 
      </p>

      <h2>Muscle Relaxation</h2>
      <p>Progressive Muscle Relaxation teaches you how to relax your muscles through a two-step process. 
        First, you systematically tense particular muscle groups in your body, such as your neck and shoulders. 
        Next, you release the tension and notice how your muscles feel when you relax them. This exercise will help you to lower your overall tension and stress levels, and help you relax when you are feeling anxious. 
        It can also help reduce physical problems such as stomachaches and headaches, as well as improve your sleep.
      </p>
      <p>People with anxiety difficulties are often so tense throughout the day that they don't even recognize what being relaxed feels like. 
        Through practice you can learn to distinguish between the feelings of a tensed muscle and a completely relaxed muscle. 
        Then, you can begin to “cue” this relaxed state at the first sign of the muscle tension that accompanies your feelings of anxiety. 
        By tensing and releasing, you learn what relaxation feels like and how to recognize when you are starting to get tense during the day.
      </p>
      <p>HELPFUL HINTS:

        Set aside about 15 minutes to complete this exercise
        Find a place where you can complete this exercise without being disturbed
        For the first week or two, practice this exercise twice a day until you get the hang of it. The better you become at it, the quicker the relaxation response will “kick in” when you really need it
        You do not need to be feeling anxious when you practice this exercise. 
        In fact, it is better to first practice it when you are calm. That way, it will be easier to do when feeling anxious

      <h2>Breathing to Relax</h2>
      <p>Cultivating an awareness of the breath and developing good habits of breathing are key components of healing, transformation, and spiritual practice. 
        The breath is the most accessible and helpful tool we have for making progress in these areas. 
        In particular, diaphragmatic breathing regulates and balances the nervous system, supporting physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being.</p>
      <p>
       <ol>1. Nose Breathing
           Form the habit of breathing through the nose rather than through the mouth.
       </ol>
       <ol>2. Focus
          Develop the ability to focus on the breath—inhalation and exhalation. This automatically helps train your breath to be deeper and more even.
       </ol>
       <ol>3. Breathing Diaphragmatically
          Learn to breathe diaphragmatically, rather than in your chest. (When you inhale, the diaphragm presses downward, causing the abdomen to expand. 
          When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and the abdomen falls.)
       </ol>
       <ol>4. Strengthening the Diaphragm
          Then you'll want to strengthen the diaphragm to make diaphragmatic breathing more effective, connected, and efficient. 
          This is generally done with breath training practices such as crocodile pose (makarasana) and sandbag breathing.
       </ol>
