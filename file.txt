Favorite Song : Kwabs / Walk 
Lyrics:
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
100 headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once, then I never think twice
But your temptations making me stay another night
And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so raw to me, raw to me
I gotta check myself before I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was
And you know I
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messing around
And I'll be falling all the way down
Tell myself "Leave!", while I'm still strong
"Don't look back!", 'til I'm ten miles gone
And when the road stops, I'm gonna keep on
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the pressure's pushing me back again
Telling me not to pretend
There isn't any use even trying to get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground
And I'm gonna walk right up
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messing around
And I'll be falling all the way down
Won't get caught in the old fly trap
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No, no, run away, run away
Won't get caught in the old fly trap (I can't get caught up again!)
Runaway, runaway, never come back
No way I'm going down like that (no way!)
No, no, runaway, runaway (no, no!)
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messing around
And I'll be falling all the way down, yeah
I'm gonna walk now
I'm gonna walk now
Yeah, no, no, no
Better walk
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no
